This is a basic project that describes a 2-to-4 decoder in Verilog.

The verilog_decoder.v file contains the module that takes to select bits s1, s0, and outputs 1 to the corresponding output yx. 

The decoder_tb.v contains the testbench that instantiates verilog_decoder.v and simulates the inputs 00-11.

The decoder_project_xpr is the file directory used in Xilinx Vivado to create the project. 

The png is a screenshot of the resulting waveform.
